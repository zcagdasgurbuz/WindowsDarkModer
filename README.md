# WindowsDarkModer
---For Windows 10---

These batch files are solutions for difficult-to-find Windows's dark mode settings. Running the batch files will switch the dark mode.

"darkmode.bat" switches the dark mode for apps and theme  
"darkmodeonlyapps.bat" switches the dark mode for only apps.

Also, the zip file contains .exe files for convenience because .exe files do not show the terminal window at all.

You can assign key bindings with the following steps,  
-Create a shortcut to a batch file or a .exe file wherever you like.  
-Right-click to the shortcut, then select properties.  
-Click the shortcut key box, press the key combination. You will see the keys you press in the box.  
-Click apply and ok.
